I am currently the India regional director for [IDinsight](www.idinsight.org), an organization that helps non-profits and government agencies improve their programs through rigorous testing and learning.  All views expressed on this blog are my own.

In my free time, I hike, mountain bike, rock climb, and write this blog.
